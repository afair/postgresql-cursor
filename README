PostgreSQLCursor
================

A Rails/ActiveRecord plugin for the PostgreSQL database adapter that will add
cursors to a find_cursor() method to process very large result sets. 

This method uses cursors to pull in one data block (of x records) at a time, and 
return each record as a Hash to a procedural block. When each data block is 
exhausted, it will fetch the next one.

Other "hacks" simulate this by using a pagination technique to fetch each block, 
then re-running the query for the next "page". This plugin avoid re-executing
the query by using the PostgreSQL cursors. 

Example
=======

Account.find_cursor(:account_cursor, true, :all, :conditions=>["status = ?", 'good']) do |row|
  puts row.to_json
end
